    question: "What documents do I need to rent a car?",
    answer:
      "To rent a car, you typically need a valid driver's license, a credit card in the renter's name for the security deposit, and proof of insurance if you choose not to purchase the rental company's insurance. Some rental companies may have additional requirements, so it's best to check with them in advance.",

    question: "What is the minimum age to rent a car?",
    answer:
      "The minimum age to rent a car varies by country and rental company. In most locations, the minimum age is between 21 and 25 years old. However, some companies may require renters to be at least 25 years old. Additionally, drivers under the age of 25 may be subject to a young driver surcharge.",

    question: "What insurance options are available for rental cars?",
    answer:
      "Rental car companies usually offer several insurance options, including collision damage waiver (CDW), loss damage waiver (LDW), personal accident insurance, and supplemental liability protection. It's important to understand the coverage provided by each option and whether your personal insurance or credit card offers any coverage for rental cars.",

The most common options are: 1) Full-to-full: You receive the car with a full tank and are expected to return it with a full tank. 2) Pre-purchase: You pay for a full tank of fuel in advance and return the car empty. 3) Pre-determined level: You receive the car with a certain level of fuel and are expected to return it at the same level. It's important to familiarize yourself with the fuel policy before renting a car.",
